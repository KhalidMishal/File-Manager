A General-Purpose File Manager application

Used to sort, organize, and manage multiple files into cleaner, readable, and well-sorted folders.
Each folder acts as the main project, complete with descriptions, images/icons, as well as basic
file information such as the total amount of space each folder takes, amount of files, and 
the date for when it was last accessed/edited.

It currently runs on the terminal and "stores files" in a single spreadsheet, but future objectives
will aim to build a fully running app that works just as well as the built-in file manager in
Windows as well as provide additional tools to reduce any ineffciencies when working with
large projects containing multiple files, sub-folders, and multiple storage spaces (e.g. Cloud)
